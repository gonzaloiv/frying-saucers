## About the game

*Not a lot to explain. There's a bunch of UFOs coming and you're a fully armed spaceship... What could happen? Just identify each UFO's gesture and draw it on the screen. You get more points if you do it at the right time and if you keep a good streak.*

Frying Saucer is my first (full of bugs and not polished) game in Unity (I've used the library $P Point-Cloud Recognizer by Da Viking Code and the Post Processing tools by Unity). For the graphics I've used Pixelmator and for the music and SFXs Ableton Live and Bfxr. It contains sprites from freepik.com and Kenney Assets and samples from looperman.com and the Internet Archive.
